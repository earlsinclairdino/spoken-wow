// The comment rule the WoW client enforces by silently loading nothing.
//
// An XML comment may not contain a double hyphen. Every other comment in this repo is Lua, so
// writing Lua's own marker inside one of these is the natural mistake, and the punishment is
// out of all proportion: the document is invalid, the client loads NONE of the files it lists,
// and the error that reaches the player names a library nobody touched. This is what it looked
// like in practice, from one stray "--" in a comment beside a <Script> line:
//
//     Interface/AddOns/SpokenPlayer/Core.lua:8: Cannot find a library instance of "AceTimer-3.0"
//
// Deliberately narrow. This is not a schema check and not a parser: Blizzard's UI.xsd is not
// vendored here, and a real parser would be a dependency for one rule. It checks the rule that
// has actually bitten, plus that every comment is closed, and says so rather than pretending to
// validate more.
