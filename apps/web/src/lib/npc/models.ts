/**
 * What race and gender a model file belongs to.
 *
 * The addon sends the raw file id its client reported and nothing else, so this table lives
 * here rather than in Lua: a race added upstream, or an id that turns out to mean something
 * else, is corrected in one deploy instead of waiting for every player to take an addon
 * update -- and the legacy-client players install zips by hand, so some of them never would.
 *
 * Only character models are in it. An NPC drawn with a creature model -- a murloc, a dragon,
 * an elemental -- resolves to nothing, which is the honest answer: the corpus already carries
 * `narrator-male` as a pseudo-race for things that do not have one.
