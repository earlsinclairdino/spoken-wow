-- The format a contribution leaves the game in.
--
-- Plain text, not serialised and not compressed. An envelope is a few kilobytes, and
-- LibDeflate plus LibSerialize would be two vendored libraries and a pure-Lua inflate on a
-- 1.12 client to save bytes nobody pays for. It also lets the player read what they are about
-- to send, which matters when the payload is their own client's text.
--
-- THE READER IS apps/web/src/lib/contributions/envelope.ts AND THE TWO MUST AGREE. Fixtures
-- written by tests/lua/contribute_envelope_test.lua are what holds them together; the failure
-- mode otherwise is the one Checksum.lua describes -- silent, and indistinguishable from a
-- corpus that simply has nothing.

--- modulus is the largest signed 32-bit prime, so every intermediate stays exact in a double.
